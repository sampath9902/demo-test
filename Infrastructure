Hosting Provider: I would choose a reputable cloud provider like AWS for their robust networking capabilities and security features.

Kubernetes Cluster: Deploy a managed Kubernetes service such as self managed cluster using aws instances & Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on AWS. These managed services handle cluster management, scaling, and upgrades, reducing operational overhead.

Web Services Deployment:

Deploy the web services as Kubernetes Pods using containerized applications.
Expose the services to the internet using a combination of Ingress Controllers and Load Balancers to provide external access to the API endpoints securely.

Monitoring and Alerting:

Implement monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of the Kubernetes cluster and web services.
Configure alerting mechanisms to notify the support team in case of connectivity issues with the internal assets. This can be achieved using tools like Prometheus Alertmanager or cloud provider's native monitoring solutions.

Continuous Deployment (CD):

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins to automate the deployment process.
Developers can commit code changes to version control systems like Git, triggering automated builds and deployments to the Kubernetes cluster.

Security Measures:

Implement network policies and firewall rules to restrict access to the Kubernetes cluster from the internet, allowing only necessary traffic.
Utilize HTTPS/TLS encryption for securing communication between clients and the web services.
Secure sensitive information like API keys and credentials using Kubernetes Secrets or a secure secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault.
Enable RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to control access to resources within the Kubernetes cluster.
Implement Pod Security Policies to enforce security standards and best practices for containerized applications.
Use network isolation techniques such as Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) or Virtual Networks to isolate the Kubernetes cluster from other networks and ensure secure communication with internal assets.

Accessing Internal Systems:

Establish a secure connection between the Kubernetes cluster and the internal assets on the "internal-assets" virtual network.
Utilize VPN (Virtual Private Network) or VPC Peering to establish private connectivity between the Kubernetes cluster and the internal network.
Configure appropriate network security groups and access control lists to restrict access to internal systems based on least privilege principles.

Technologies Selection:

Cloud Provider: AWS.
Managed Kubernetes Service: Amazon EKS, self managed kubernetes cluster.
Ingress Controller: NGINX Ingress Controller or AWS ALB Ingress Controller.
Monitoring and Alerting: Prometheus, Grafana, Prometheus Alertmanager.
CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins.
Secret Management: Kubernetes Secrets, HashiCorp Vault.
Security: Network Policies, HTTPS/TLS, RBAC, Pod Security Policies, VPC, VPN/VPC Peering.
